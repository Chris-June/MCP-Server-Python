# MCP Server: Finance and Investment Use Cases

## Introduction

This document explores how the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server can be adapted to serve financial and investment needs across various contexts, from wealth management to risk assessment and financial planning. By reconfiguring the MCP's architecture with finance-specific roles, domain knowledge, and specialized prompts, it can become a powerful Financial Intelligence System that enhances investment decisions, risk management, and financial analysis.

**Important Note**: All financial implementations must prioritize data security, regulatory compliance, and appropriate disclaimers regarding financial advice. The MCP Server should be configured to operate as a tool that assists financial professionals rather than providing direct financial advice to end users without appropriate oversight.
